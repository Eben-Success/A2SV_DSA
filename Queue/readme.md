# QUEUE DATA STRUCTURE

Queue follows the First In First Out (FIFO) rule.

## Basic Operations of Queue
* Enqueue: add an element to the end of a queue.
* Dequeue: remove an element from the front of the queue.
* IsEmpty: check if queue is empty.
* Peek: Get the value of the front of the queue without removing it.

## Working of Queue
Queue operations work as follows:
* two pointers `FRONT` and `REAR`.
* `FRONT` track the first elemnent of the queue.
* `REAR` track the last element of the queue.
  * Initially, set value of `FRONT` and `REAR` to -1
