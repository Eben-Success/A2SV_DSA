# Counting Sort

>- Counting sort is a sorting algorithm that sorts the elements of an array by counting the number of occurences of each unique element in the array.

### Time Complexity


|Time                         | Cases    
|----------------|----------|
|Best Case| `O(n+k)` |
|Worst Case         | `O(n+k)` 
|Average Case         | `O(n+k)` |


Space Complexity: O(max)
The larger the range of element, the larger the space complexity.
Stablity: Yes
