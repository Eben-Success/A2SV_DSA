# Recursion

Recursion is a function that calls itself.

### Pros
* Bridges the gap between elegance and complexity.
* Reduce the need for complex loops and auxiliary data structures.
* Can reduce time complexity easily with memorization.
* Works really well with recursive structures like trees and graphs.


### Cons
* Slowness due to CPU overhead
* Can lead to out of memory error or stack overflow exceptions.
* Can be unnecessarily complex if poorly constructed.
